You will find many kinds of projects on here, from contributions to Open Source libraries I tried to use and then broke and decided to fix, to projects to back up my [blogposts](https://divanv.com/), to just random experiments that I find useful to keep.

While I write mainly backend microservice stuff by day, on here I pretty much just solve any computer related problem I have with code; whether it's [controlling my fan speed](https://github.com/Sector-F-Labs/nv-settings-cli) or solving my [20GB Skyrim save file problem](https://github.com/divanvisagie/Arcanaeum) it's all fair game for this polyglot programmer.

You will find the projects I am most proud of pinned below.
